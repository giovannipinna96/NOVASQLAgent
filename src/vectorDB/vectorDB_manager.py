"""
This module is designed to create and manage an open-source vector database using a dedicated Python class
that encapsulates all required functionality for storage, retrieval, and similarity-based search.

OBJECTIVES AND FUNCTIONALITY:

1. VECTOR DATABASE BACKEND:
    - This file is responsible for initializing and interacting with an open-source vector database.
    - The specific vector database implementation (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Qdrant, Weaviate, etc.) can be selected freely,
      as long as it is efficient, well-maintained, and open-source.
    - The implementation must be wrapped inside a dedicated management class for full modularity and abstraction.

2. CORE CLASS REQUIREMENTS:
    - A single class must handle all interactions with the vector database, including:
        • Adding new data points (vectors + metadata)
        • Removing existing data points based on unique identifiers or filters
        • Saving and loading the index/database to/from disk

3. SEMANTIC SIMILARITY SEARCH:
    - The class must include functionality to perform semantic search based on vector similarity.
    - A default embedding model can be used to convert textual data into vector representations.
    - The system must support **two similarity metrics**:
        • Cosine Similarity
        • L2 (Euclidean Distance)
    - A configurable switch must allow the developer to select which metric to use during a query.

4. COLUMN-WISE SEARCH LOGIC:
    - The database must support semantic similarity search across **multiple specific fields (columns)**.
    - For a given query, the system should compute similarity independently for each field and return the top-matching
      value from each field.
    - This enables targeted semantic extraction from structured documents or datasets.

5. NON-VECTOR SEARCH CAPABILITIES:
    - Include simple keyword-based or exact-match search capabilities for querying specific fields in the database
      without relying on embeddings or similarity measures.
    - These methods must support filters, field-based lookups, and logical query composition (e.g., AND/OR conditions).

6. PERSISTENCE AND FILESYSTEM INTEGRATION:
    - The system must include methods to save the current state of the vector index/database to disk.
    - It must also support loading an existing index on startup, including appropriate file/folder structure handling.

7. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
    - All methods should include robust error handling, type annotations, and logging support.
    - Where possible, use modern Python features (e.g., dataclasses, context managers, pathlib).
    - Provide informative docstrings for all methods and maintain a clean object-oriented architecture.
    - Consider exposing an interface or configuration object to allow users to easily plug in different embedding models
      or switch between vector backends.
    - Ensure the class supports batch insertion and batch querying for performance scalability.

8. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
    - Follow Python best practices in every part of this implementation:
        • PEP8-compliant code formatting
        • Type hints and input validation
        • Unit-testable modular methods
        • Well-documented and maintainable codebase

This module is a core component of a semantic intelligence system and must serve as a high-performance layer
for managing and querying contextual embeddings within a flexible, customizable, and production-grade architecture.
