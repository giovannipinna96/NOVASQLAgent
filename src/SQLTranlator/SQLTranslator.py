"""
This module provides a structured interface for translating SQL queries from one dialect to another
using the open-source `sqlglot` library (https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot).

MODULE OBJECTIVES:

1. PURPOSE:
    - The primary goal of this file is to offer a clean and extensible implementation for translating SQL queries
      across different SQL dialects using `sqlglot` as the backend parser and transpiler.
    - It allows for integration into complex pipelines where SQL dialect normalization is required,
      such as database migration, benchmarking, or SQL generation tasks.

2. FUNCTIONALITY:
    - This module should expose either a main class or a set of utility functions that:
        • Accept an SQL query as input (in string form)
        • Accept a target SQL dialect (as a string or Enum)
        • Use `sqlglot` to parse and transpile the query to the desired dialect
        • Return the translated query as a string, or raise an informative exception if translation fails

3. DIALECT ENUM:
    - A custom Enum should be defined within this file to explicitly list and constrain the supported SQL dialects.
    - This improves type safety and ensures consistency across the codebase by avoiding loose string matching.
    - Example enum values may include: `MYSQL`, `POSTGRES`, `SQLITE`, `BIGQUERY`, `DUCKDB`, etc.
    - The mapping between Enum values and `sqlglot`-recognized dialect strings must be explicitly handled.

4. ERROR HANDLING AND VALIDATION:
    - The implementation should include proper validation of inputs and dialects.
    - In case of unsupported dialects, malformed queries, or sqlglot errors, raise exceptions with clear and informative messages.

5. CODE QUALITY AND BEST PRACTICES:
    - The implementation must follow Python best practices:
        • Use PEP8 style and naming conventions
        • Annotate all functions and methods with proper type hints
        • Include docstrings for all public interfaces
        • Use logging for traceability and debugging
        • Keep the interface modular and easily extendable (e.g., pluggable dialect support or reverse-translation)

6. EXTENSIBILITY:
    - The system should be designed to allow future enhancements such as:
        • Bidirectional translation (auto-detect source dialect)
        • Query formatting and linting
        • Batch translation of multiple queries
        • Integration with SQL AST analysis if required

This module is a foundational building block for any system requiring SQL query adaptation across engines
and must ensure reliability, maintainability, and clarity in its translation pipeline.
