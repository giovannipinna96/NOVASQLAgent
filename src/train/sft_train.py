This file implements a system for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Hugging Face-compatible language models,
using the official Hugging Face libraries such as `SFTTrainer`, `PEFT`, and `LoRA`. It is optimized for 
distributed training on multiple GPUs within the same node using the `Accelerate` library.

OBJECTIVES AND FUNCTIONALITY:

1. TRAINING BACKEND AND ARCHITECTURE:
    - The training pipeline must utilize Hugging Face’s `SFTTrainer` to perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
    - It should support LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning), leveraging 
      `peft` integration provided by Hugging Face for efficient training on large models.
    - The system must be compatible with Hugging Face’s `Accelerate` to enable distributed multi-GPU training.
      Use `accelerate.launch` or equivalent mechanisms for execution.

2. COMMAND-LINE CONFIGURATION:
    - All essential training parameters must be configurable via command-line arguments (e.g., using `argparse` or `typer`).
    - Configurable parameters include (but are not limited to):
        • Model name or path
        • Output directory
        • Dataset path or name
        • Number of training epochs
        • Batch size (train/eval)
        • Learning rate
        • LoRA-specific configurations (e.g., r, alpha, dropout)
        • PEFT configuration
        • Resume training (boolean flag)
        • Logging and evaluation strategy

3. TRAINER CONFIGURATION (TrainerConf):
    - Define a `TrainerConf` class or dataclass to encapsulate all training configuration parameters.
    - This should include:
        • Optimizer settings
        • Scheduler settings
        • Evaluation strategy
        • Checkpointing frequency
        • Mixed-precision (FP16/BF16)
        • Save/load/resume control
        • Gradient accumulation settings

4. TRAINING RESUMPTION:
    - Include functionality to resume interrupted training runs using a boolean flag such as `--resume_training`.
    - Ensure checkpoints are stored consistently and loaded correctly if resuming from the latest checkpoint.

5. DATA MANAGEMENT:
    - Implement utilities to load and preprocess training data efficiently.
    - Allow support for Hugging Face datasets (via `datasets.load_dataset`) and custom local datasets.
    - Include methods to tokenize, format, and group texts for causal or seq2seq training depending on the task type.
    - Ensure compatibility with both JSON and CSV formats for user flexibility.

6. CODE QUALITY AND PYTHON BEST PRACTICES:
    - Full adherence to modern Python best practices:
        • Use of type hints and data classes for configuration.
        • Modular design: separate data loading, training, evaluation, and utility functions.
        • Clear, consistent logging and exception handling.
        • PEP8-compliant formatting and readable code organization.
        • Docstrings and in-line comments for all classes and public functions.
    - Designed for reproducibility, robustness, and scalability in production training pipelines.

This module serves as a critical component for scalable and efficient fine-tuning of large-scale language models,
ensuring seamless integration with Hugging Face’s tools and optimal use of compute resources via Accelerate.
