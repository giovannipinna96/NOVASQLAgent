"""
This file is intended for implementing a fine-tuning pipeline based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
technique, specifically applied to Hugging Face-compatible language models. The code must integrate with Hugging Face's
`GRPOTrainer`, use LoRA/PEFT for efficient parameter updates, and utilize the `Accelerate` library for distributed
multi-GPU training within a single node.

OBJECTIVES AND FUNCTIONALITY:

1. TRAINING ARCHITECTURE AND LIBRARIES:
    - Fine-tuning is conducted via the GRPO algorithm using Hugging Face's `GRPOTrainer`.
    - Training should be designed for distributed GPU setups using `Accelerate` for maximum scalability.
    - The model must be wrapped with PEFT techniques such as LoRA to enable low-rank adaptation without fully fine-tuning the base model.
    - Fully leverage Hugging Face's model, tokenizer, and training APIs for maximum compatibility and maintainability.

2. COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE:
    - All training-relevant parameters must be passed via the command line using `argparse` or `typer`.
    - Parameters should include:
        • Model path or identifier
        • Output directory
        • Dataset path or name
        • LoRA hyperparameters (e.g., r, alpha, dropout)
        • Training configuration (epochs, batch sizes, learning rate, etc.)
        • Resume flag to continue training from a previous checkpoint
        • Evaluation strategy and logging frequency

3. TRAINING CONFIGURATION:
    - Define a centralized `TrainerConf` (class or dataclass) to encapsulate all configurable hyperparameters and settings.
    - This should include:
        • Checkpointing and save strategies
        • Evaluation frequency
        • Tokenizer settings
        • PEFT configuration
        • Learning rate scheduler
        • Mixed precision setup (FP16/BF16)
        • Gradient clipping and accumulation
        • Reward model stub configuration (see below)

4. RESUME SUPPORT:
    - Include a `--resume_training` boolean flag to support automatic resumption from the last saved checkpoint.
    - Ensure all training state (optimizer, scheduler, global step, etc.) is restored correctly.

5. DATA HANDLING:
    - Provide methods for loading, preprocessing, and formatting datasets for GRPO.
    - Support both Hugging Face datasets and local files (CSV, JSON, etc.).
    - Ensure data is tokenized and batched properly for reward modeling and policy learning.

6. REWARD FUNCTIONS:
    - Stub out placeholder functions or classes for reward modeling logic.
    - Leave reward logic unimplemented for now, with a placeholder `# TODO` indicating where custom reward functions should be added.

7. CODE QUALITY AND BEST PRACTICES:
    - Follow strict Python best practices, including:
        • Use of type annotations throughout
        • PEP8-compliant formatting
        • Modular, reusable, and testable code structure
        • Clear docstrings and inline comments
        • Robust exception handling and input validation
    - Code should be production-grade, well-organized, and maintainable by both humans and automated systems.

This module is a foundation for training language models via reinforcement learning using GRPO. It must support distributed execution, be tightly integrated with Hugging Face’s ecosystem, and serve as a reliable baseline for experimentation and future production deployment.
