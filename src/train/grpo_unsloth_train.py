This file implements a fine-tuning pipeline for Hugging Face-compatible language models using the 
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. The system is specifically designed to integrate 
the performance-optimized libraries `vLLM` and `Unsloth` while leveraging `Accelerate` for distributed 
training on multiple GPUs within a single node.

OBJECTIVES AND FUNCTIONALITY:

1. INTEGRATION OF vLLM AND UNSLOTH:
    - The training pipeline must be built to work seamlessly with both `vLLM` and `Unsloth`, 
      combining their strengths for efficient model loading, inference, and fine-tuning.
    - Proper care must be taken to ensure compatibility between these two libraries, 
      especially in memory management, tensor formats, and tokenizer/model handling.
    - vLLM is primarily used for optimized inference and serving, while Unsloth enhances training efficiency 
      and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) integration.
    - Both libraries must be integrated carefully to ensure no conflicts arise and that their optimizations are preserved.

2. DISTRIBUTED TRAINING VIA ACCELERATE:
    - The training process must run on multiple GPUs using Hugging Face’s `Accelerate` framework for distributed training.
    - Training must support mixed-precision (FP16/BF16), device placement, and data parallelism automatically.

3. COMMAND-LINE CONFIGURATION:
    - All relevant training parameters must be configurable from the command line (via `argparse`, `typer`, or similar).
    - These parameters include:
        • Model name or path
        • Dataset path or identifier
        • Number of epochs, batch size, learning rate
        • LoRA and PEFT configurations (rank, alpha, dropout)
        • Output directory and logging frequency
        • Resume training flag (boolean)
        • Tokenizer options and padding/truncation strategies

4. CONFIGURATION STRUCTURE:
    - Define a `TrainerConf` class or dataclass to encapsulate all hyperparameters and configuration settings.
    - It must include fields for:
        • Optimizer/scheduler configuration
        • Checkpointing and evaluation strategies
        • Gradient accumulation steps
        • Mixed-precision options
        • PEFT-specific options (e.g., use of adapters, merging strategies)

5. TRAINING RESUMPTION:
    - Implement a boolean flag `--resume_training` to allow resuming training from a previous checkpoint.
    - All training state (model, optimizer, scheduler, step count) must be restored reliably.

6. DATA MANAGEMENT:
    - Include utility functions or data loaders to efficiently prepare datasets for training with GRPO.
    - Support loading from Hugging Face datasets and local files in formats like JSON, CSV, and Parquet.
    - Implement tokenization, formatting, and reward-preprocessing logic (as placeholders for now).

7. REWARD FUNCTION:
    - Stub out reward function logic to be filled in later.
    - Use `# TODO` markers where reward scoring or feedback computation will eventually be implemented.

8. CODE QUALITY AND BEST PRACTICES:
    - Ensure adherence to modern Python development standards:
        • PEP8-compliant formatting and spacing
        • Type annotations and data validation
        • Clear and modular code organization
        • Comprehensive logging and error handling
        • Proper documentation and docstrings for all public classes and functions
    - Structure the code for long-term maintainability, testability, and scalability.

This module is foundational for reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning using GRPO, tightly coupled with
modern libraries like vLLM and Unsloth for enhanced performance. It is designed to be scalable, modular, 
and production-grade, suitable for large-scale experiments and deployment-ready systems.
