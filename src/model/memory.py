"""
This file is dedicated to implementing a robust memory management system for handling LLM-driven conversations.
The primary goal is to support agent-based architectures in which each agent maintains its own memory of messages
(sent and received) along with metadata and structural utilities to support advanced conversational workflows.

CORE REQUIREMENTS AND FUNCTIONALITY:

1. CONVERSATION MEMORY MANAGEMENT:
    - Implement a system (class or module) that stores conversations as structured sequences of messages.
    - Each message should contain:
        • The message content (string).
        • A unique message identifier (UUID or similar).
        • The direction of the message (incoming or outgoing).
        • The name of the LLM model that generated or received the message (fetched from the `LLMmodel.py` class attribute `name`).
    - Each agent should have its own instance of conversation memory to maintain individualized histories.

2. MESSAGE DELETION:
    - Provide methods to easily delete:
        • Specific messages by ID.
        • All messages before or after a certain timestamp or index.
        • Messages matching specific filters (e.g., LLM name, content keywords, etc.).

3. CONVERSATION SUMMARIZATION:
    - When a conversation exceeds a predefined maximum token length (default value settable via class constant or constructor argument),
      the system must:
        • Tokenize the conversation using the tokenizer associated with the LLM in use.
        • Automatically summarize the full conversation using a summarization-capable LLM.
        • Replace the full memory with a single summarized message to preserve token budget.
    - Token counting must be accurate and compatible with both local (HuggingFace) and API-based models.

4. JSON EXPORT AND IMPORT:
    - Implement methods to:
        • Export the entire conversation memory to a JSON file or string.
        • Reconstruct a conversation memory instance from a JSON file or JSON-formatted string.
    - Ensure exported format preserves all necessary fields for full rehydration (message ID, LLM name, timestamps, etc.).

5. TEMPORAL SNAPSHOT STORAGE:
    - Maintain a snapshot log of all conversation states across time.
    - Every modification (insertion, deletion, summarization) should create a versioned snapshot.
    - Provide a method to restore the conversation memory to any prior snapshot by timestamp or snapshot ID.

6. SYSTEM INTEGRATION:
    - The memory management system must be fully compatible and tightly integrated with:
        • `LLMmodel.py`: to access model names, tokenizers, and generation capabilities.
        • `prompt_template_manager.py`: to manage and optionally format prompts for summarization or reconstruction.

7. CODE QUALITY AND BEST PRACTICES:
    - Follow all standard Python best practices:
        • Full type annotations and PEP8-compliant formatting.
        • Use of Python `dataclasses` or `TypedDict` for clear message structuring.
        • Meaningful logging and exception handling.
        • Modularity and reusability for agent- or multi-agent systems.
    - Use docstrings for all public classes and methods.
    - Ensure extensibility to support future features like message encryption, memory pruning strategies, or hierarchical memory.

This module forms the backbone of long-term memory for agent-based LLM applications and is designed to support
complex interaction histories with persistence, summarization, and recovery capabilities.
