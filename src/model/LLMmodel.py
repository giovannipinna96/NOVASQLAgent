"""
This file defines the foundational architecture for managing and interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs)
using Python. The codebase should follow best practices in Python programming, ensuring scalability, clarity,
and modularity. The overall goal is to provide a robust interface for both local and remote (API-based) LLMs,
including prompt handling, inference execution, and memory management.

STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:

1. ABSTRACT BASE CLASS (OR PROTOCOL):
    - A base abstract class or typing.Protocol must be created to serve as the ancestor of all LLM-related classes.
    - This class should define:
        • An abstract method `run()` for executing inference with the LLM.
        • Core attributes such as:
            - `model_name`: a string representing the model identifier or path.
            - `task`: a string describing the task the model is assigned to (e.g., summarization, QA).
            - `prompt_path`: a string path to the template file to be used for prompt generation.
        • A method `load_prompt_template(input_dict: dict) -> str`:
            - This method should read the prompt template file from `prompt_path`.
            - It should format the prompt using the values provided in the `input_dict`.
        • A `__str__` or `__print__` method that outputs a well-formatted and readable summary
          of the model instance, its configuration, and state.

2. HUGGINGFACE-BASED LLM CLASS:
    - This class should inherit from the base class and be responsible for loading and interacting
      with models hosted on Hugging Face (either pre-trained or fine-tuned).
    - Required features:
        • Initialization parameters should include flags such as:
            - `use_4bit`: if True, load the model in 4-bit precision.
            - `use_8bit`: if True, load in 8-bit precision.
            - `use_memory`: if True, enable memory or conversation context handling.
        • Auto-detection of LoRA adapters:
            - If `model_name` is a path and contains PEFT adapters (e.g., LoRA), it should automatically
              load the adapters using `peft`.
        • A method `load_chat_template()` for preparing chat-based prompts when applicable.
        • Any additional methods or attributes needed to support memory buffer management, tokenizer
          loading, batching, and model generation.

3. API-BASED LLM CLASS:
    - This class should also inherit from the base class, and it should serve as a wrapper for interacting
      with remote LLMs via API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude Sonnet).
    - Required features:
        • API client configuration and authentication.
        • A `run()` implementation that sends the request and parses the response.
        • Support for session-based memory management (e.g., conversation history stored and reused).
        • Abstraction layer to make the use of different APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) interchangeable
          through unified methods and interface logic.
        • Optional retry logic and rate limit handling.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND BEST PRACTICES:
    - All classes should be fully type-annotated with `mypy`-friendly hints.
    - Use of Python’s `abc` module for abstract base classes if necessary.
    - Follow PEP8 standards and apply docstrings to all public methods and classes.
    - Separate concerns: prompt formatting, model loading, inference, and memory should be modular.
    - Consider using dependency injection and configuration classes (e.g., via `pydantic`) for extensibility.
    - Logging should be implemented to trace usage, errors, and debug information where appropriate.

This file serves as the core logic layer for a broader framework or application that leverages LLMs for complex tasks,
and it should be designed to be easily extensible and maintainable.
